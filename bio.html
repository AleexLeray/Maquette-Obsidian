            <p>“It’s akin to the ancient art of Bonsai,” explains Bonn O’Brien
                between sips of house blend at a Brooklyn coffee shop. “It takes
                patience. It takes an eye for detail. It’s reverence, respect,
                and a steady hand all rolled into one. It’s the only way to take
                care of a proper beard. We take the same approach to our music.”<br/>
                <br/>
                Three years ago, the O’Brien-lead The Dapper Beards burst into
                the country’s collective consciousness like a Salvador
                Dali ‘stache thanks to their now-iconic appearance on the cover
                of the trendy periodical “Garden and Gun.” “The Beards Are Here,
                And They Will Save Folk Music” read the headline. The striking
                image of the four bandmates in repose, silhouetted by a SoHo
                sunset was an immediate viral sensation.<br/>
                <br/>
                “We sued,” says O’Brien with a twist of his mustache, “that’s
                how it went viral. I don’t think anyone had seen a bold move
                like that– a band, suing to protect their image after signing
                off on the cover. We owe a big thanks to The Smoking Gun for
                making that happen. We had approved the cover, but we hadn’t
                approved of the people who were going to be reading the magazine.
                Turns out they didn’t approach that story with the kind of
                reverence with which we treat our beards– the same approach we
                take to our music– and we didn’t appreciate that.”<br/>
                <br/>
                And the Folk pigeonhole? O’Brien didn’t take kindly to that, either.<br/>
                <br/>
                “They never took the time to ask for the spelling. It may sound
                like the word that is commonly used to describe some kinds of
                roots music, but it wasn’t the word that we were using. It’s not
                even the music we’re doing. Folk– and that’s the only time I’m
                going to use that word– is so over. We’re Fauxlk. Pronounced the
                same way as Folk– which, really, is the last time I’m going to
                use that word– but it’s spelled F-a-u-x-l-k. If you’re not going
                to ask us about our music, which we take great care in– similar
                to the way in which we care for our beards– how can we expect you
                to represent our movement in its proper context to your readers?”<br/>
                <br/>
                The ever-serious O’Brien and his band cared not for the lucky
                break– a musical outfit landing a cover on one of America’s more
                respected musical magazines before ever releasing an album or
                staging a public performance– if that break wasn’t going to come
                on their own terms.<br/>
                <br/>
                “We take great care in our music, which is also the way we– right,
                you said it– and we’ll be damned if we’re going to let some media
                machine run roughshod over us.”<br/>
                <br/>
                With the lawsuit now fully behind them (it was thrown out of the
                only court that would hear the groundbreaking piece of litigation–
                a television courtroom show that is, as its producers kindly
                reminded us, indeed legally binding within the judicial system),
                The Dapper Beards are now looking towards the future.<br/>
                <br/>
                “We’re the foremost representatives of Fauxlk music… the face and
                beards of the movement, if you will. We take that responsibility
                very seriously, which is the same way in, well, yeah. So, yeah,
                we’re serious”<br/>
                <br/>
                And when will the world get to experience this movement firsthand?<br/>
                <br/>
                “Soon,” says O’Brien. “We’re thinking about writing our first
                song, and maybe even playing it at an open mic really soon.
                But it’s not going to be one of those slapped-together open mic’s,
                mind you. It’s going to be a really serious one.”</p>

          <h2>History of Popular Music</h2>

          <h6>by Brody Vercher	on December 15, 2014</h6>

          <p>“The most significant feature of the emergent popular music
          industry of the late 18th and early 19th centuries was the extent
          of its focus on the commodity form of sheet music” The availability
          of inexpensive, widely available sheet music versions of popular
          songs and instrumental music pieces made it possible for music to
          be disseminated to a wide audience of amateur music-makers, who
          could play and sing popular music at home. In addition to the
          influence of sheet music, another factor was the increasing
          availability during the late 18th and early 19th century of
          public popular music performances in “pleasure gardens and dance
          halls, popular theatres and concert rooms”. The early popular music
          performers worked hand-in-hand with the sheet music industry to
          promote popular sheet music. One of the early popular music
          performers to attain widespread popularity was a Swedish opera
          singer Jenny Lind, who toured the US in the mid-19th century.
          During the 19th century, more people began getting involved in music
          by participating in amateur choirs or joining brass bands.

          <h2>In Every Work of Genius We Recognize Our Own Rejected Thoughts</h2>

          <h6>by Brody Vercher	on December 12, 2014</h6>

          <p>I read the other day some verses written by an eminent painter
          which were original and not conventional. The soul always hears an
          admonition in such lines, let the subject be what it may. The
          sentiment they instil is of more value than any thought they may
          contain. To believe your own thought, to believe that what is true
          for you in your private heart is true for all men,—that is genius.
          Speak your latent conviction, and it shall be the universal sense;
          for the inmost in due time becomes the outmost, and our first thought
          is rendered back to us by the trumpets of the Last Judgment. Familiar
          as the voice of the mind is to each, the highest merit we ascribe to
          Moses, Plato and Milton is that they set at naught books and
          traditions, and spoke not what men, but what they thought. A man
          should learn to detect and watch that gleam of light which flashes
          across his mind from within, more than the lustre of the firmament
          of bards and sages. Yet he dismisses without notice his thought,
          because it is his. In every work of genius we recognize our own
          rejected thoughts; they come back to us with a certain alienated
          majesty. Great works of art have no more affecting lesson for us than
          this. They teach us to abide by our spontaneous impression with good-
          humored inflexibility then most when the whole cry of voices is on the
          other side. Else to-morrow a stranger will say with masterly good
          sense precisely what we have thought and felt all the time, and we
          shall be forced to take with shame our own opinion from another.</p>
